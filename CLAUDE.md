# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

`nexus` is a Rust workspace (edition 2021) for deriving insider trading signals from public market data.

## Crates

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `model` | Common types and protobuf-generated messages shared across the workspace (`Bar`, `Asset`, `Price`, `MarketEvent`, `EarningsEvent`, etc.) |
| `alpha` | Library providing data-fetching interfaces (`BarProvider`, `PolygonBarProvider`, `PriceProvider`). Pure data access — no Kafka, no analysis. |
| `chronicle` | Ingestion binaries that fetch raw data and publish it as protobuf to Kafka. Two binaries: `chronicle` (SEC EDGAR → `earnings.calendar`) and `market` (Polygon EOD bars → `market.bars`). |
| `signal` | Consumes Kafka topics, derives trading signals, and persists results to Postgres. |
| `insight` | MCP server exposing derived results from `signal` to LLM clients. |

## Data flow

```
SEC EDGAR ──► chronicle ──► earnings.calendar (EarningsEvent)
                                                               ──► signal ──► Postgres ──► insight
Polygon ────► market ────► market.bars       (MarketEvent)
```
